Disparity extender tweaks
 [ ] Consider curves from map/plan for dynamic safety dist
 [ ] Solve follow the gap traps by right/left preference (possibly dependent on location)
 [x] Later braking
 [x] Steering gain only if slow
 [ ] Mitigate oscillations due to changing safety radii (maybe some time averaging, or looking behind safety radius)
